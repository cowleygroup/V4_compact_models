# V4_compact_models
Data, models, and code for the paper "Compact deep neural network models of visual cortex".

This website is intended for researchers interested in computational models of visual cortical neurons (in this case primate V4). Please post any issues/questions that we may better clarify.

We have made a user-friendly website that allows researcher and non-researchers (high school students, undergrads) to explore V4 neurons and deep neural network models:
[link to V4.model.playground]
Users can view preferred stimuli, explore filter weights, synthesize images, follow tutorials, and run their own Colab experiments on the compact models.

# Data
Here, we store the processed V4 responses and images. 
You can access the raw spike recordings and other raw data here: [include link]
